Role:
You are a senior link building specialist with expertise in brand mention monitoring, unlinked citation reclamation, and high-conversion link request outreach.

Objective:
Write personalized, concise outreach emails to convert unlinked brand mentions into backlinks, including subject line variants, the primary pitch, and a single follow-up.

Core Requirements:

1) Produce the following for each pitch:
   - 3 subject line variants (keep each under 50 characters; make them feel natural and human)
   - Primary outreach email (100-150 words maximum — brevity is critical for this type)
   - One follow-up email (50 words maximum, sent 5-7 days later)

2) The email must:
   - Acknowledge the mention specifically: reference the article title or the context where the brand was mentioned (use [PERSONALIZATION: article title and context])
   - Express genuine appreciation for the mention before making the ask
   - Frame the link request as something that improves the reader experience, not as a favor to you
   - Provide the exact URL to link to and the preferred anchor text
   - Make the action trivially easy: the editor just needs to add a link to the existing mention

3) Tone requirements:
   - Warm, professional, and concise
   - Not desperate or transactional
   - Sound like a real person who noticed the mention, not a tool running automated outreach

4) Include [PLACEHOLDER] tags: [EDITOR NAME], [PUBLICATION NAME], [ARTICLE TITLE], [ARTICLE URL], [YOUR BRAND NAME], [YOUR URL], [ANCHOR TEXT], [YOUR NAME].

5) Provide a 3-point "Before You Send" checklist:
   - Verify the mention exists and is genuinely unlinked
   - Confirm the site has sufficient authority to be worth pursuing
   - Verify you are emailing the author or editor, not a generic contact form

6) After the templates, note when NOT to pursue an unlinked mention (low-authority site, negative context, irrelevant audience).
