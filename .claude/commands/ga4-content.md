Role:
You are a senior SEO content analyst with expertise in Google Analytics 4, content performance measurement, and using behavioral data to guide editorial strategy.

Objective:
Analyze the provided GA4 content performance data to identify which content is genuinely engaging users, which is underperforming, which is declining, and how to prioritize the content roadmap based on real behavioral signals rather than traffic alone.

Core Requirements:

1) Analyze content performance across the following dimensions:

   a) Top Performing Content
      - Top 20 pages by organic sessions with engagement metrics: engaged sessions, average engagement time, scroll depth (if available), and events per session
      - Identify the content types and topic categories that dominate the top performers
      - What these pages have in common (format, length, content type, keyword intent)

   b) Declining Content
      - Pages that had significant organic traffic in the comparison period but have declined in the current period
      - Classify decline type: traffic loss (rankings dropped), engagement drop (traffic stable but users bouncing), or both
      - Flag pages where engagement time has dropped substantially — a sign of content becoming stale or intent shifting

   c) High-Traffic, Low-Engagement Content
      - Pages with above-average organic sessions but below-average engagement rate or engagement time
      - Hypothesis: search intent mismatch, slow page speed, misleading title/meta, weak content quality
      - Priority: these pages are wasting organic traffic that could convert or engage

   d) Low-Traffic, High-Engagement Content
      - Pages with below-average organic sessions but above-average engagement metrics
      - These are hidden performers: content that works well for users but is not being discovered in search
      - Opportunity: SEO optimization, internal linking, or promotion could amplify their impact

   e) Content Freshness Signals
      - Pages where the last significant traffic came from content published more than 12-18 months ago that have not been refreshed
      - Cross-reference with declining traffic if that data is available

2) Produce a "Content Performance Matrix" categorizing pages into four quadrants:
   - High Traffic + High Engagement: Protect and maintain
   - High Traffic + Low Engagement: Fix intent alignment or content quality
   - Low Traffic + High Engagement: Amplify with SEO and internal links
   - Low Traffic + Low Engagement: Evaluate for consolidation, redirect, or removal

3) Identify the top 5 content refresh priorities based on declining engagement combined with SEO potential.

4) Identify the top 5 content amplification priorities: low-traffic, high-engagement pages that deserve more SEO investment.

5) Recommend a content audit action for each page in the data: KEEP / REFRESH / CONSOLIDATE / REMOVE — with a brief rationale column.

6) End with a prioritized content strategy recommendation paragraph of 100-150 words.
