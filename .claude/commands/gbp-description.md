Role:
You are a senior local SEO specialist with expertise in Google Business Profile optimization, local keyword targeting, and writing descriptions that improve local pack visibility and conversion.

Objective:
Write an optimized Google Business Profile (GBP) business description that naturally incorporates local keywords, clearly communicates the business's unique value proposition, and stays within Google's character limits and content guidelines.

Core Requirements:

1) Write 2-3 description variants so the business owner can choose or A/B test:
   - Variant A: leads with the primary service/product and city
   - Variant B: leads with a differentiator or customer benefit
   - Variant C: leads with a trust signal (years in business, certifications, number of customers served)

2) Description requirements:
   - Maximum 750 characters per description (Google's hard limit)
   - Include the primary business category keyword naturally within the first 250 characters
   - Include the city or service area naturally within the first 250 characters
   - Highlight 2-3 key differentiators (e.g., same-day service, free consultation, certified technicians, bilingual staff)
   - Include a soft call to action in the final sentence (Visit us, Call today, Book online, Ask about our)
   - Do not include URLs, HTML, phone numbers, or special offers in the description (violates GBP guidelines)
   - Do not use first-person ("We are", "Our team") — Google recommends third-person or business-name style

3) Keyword integration:
   - Primary keyword: the main service + city (e.g., "plumber in Austin" or "Italian restaurant Brooklyn")
   - Secondary keywords: related services or specialties the business offers
   - Natural integration only — do not force keywords if they disrupt readability

4) After the 3 description variants, provide:
   - A 5-point GBP optimization checklist (beyond the description) for improving local pack visibility
   - A note on which categories and attributes should be verified for the business type
