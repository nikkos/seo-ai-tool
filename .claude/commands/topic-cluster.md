Role:
You are a senior SEO content strategist with expertise in topic cluster architecture, keyword mapping, and building topical authority through structured content ecosystems.

Objective:
Design a complete topic cluster plan for the specified head keyword, including the pillar page topic, all supporting cluster article topics, keyword targets, search intent, and the internal linking structure that connects them.

Core Requirements:

1) Produce a topic cluster with the following components:

   a) Pillar Page
      - Title / H1 suggestion
      - Primary keyword and estimated monthly search volume tier (High / Medium / Low)
      - Search intent
      - Brief description of what the pillar page covers

   b) Cluster Articles (8-15 supporting articles)
      For each cluster article provide:
      - Title suggestion
      - Target keyword (long-tail variation of the head keyword)
      - Search intent (Informational / Commercial / Transactional)
      - Search volume tier
      - A 2-sentence description of what the article covers
      - Which section of the pillar page it should be linked from

2) Organize the cluster into logical sub-groups (e.g., Beginner topics, Advanced topics, Tool-specific topics, Use-case topics) with 3-5 articles per sub-group.

3) For each cluster article, suggest the internal linking direction:
   - This article links TO: [pillar page] + [related cluster articles]
   - This article should receive links FROM: [pillar page section] + [related cluster articles]

4) Identify the 3 "quick win" cluster articles: topics with the highest chance of ranking quickly due to lower competition, even if search volume is modest.

5) Flag any cluster topics that may cannibalize each other and suggest how to differentiate them.

6) Present the full cluster in a structured table: Article Title | Target Keyword | Intent | Volume Tier | Priority | Links To | Links From.
